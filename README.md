# Infinite Jumper

A 2D infinite Jump-Runner game 

## Gameplay

- Controls are very simple. There's a jump and long jump. 
- You need to jump through the platforms avoiding not falling down into the water. 
- There's a timer running out, to increase the timer you need to collect the time collectibles as you'd run out of time eventually. 

## Features 

- Platforms, background and collectibles all are getting generated using object pooling. 
- Platforms are getting generated with random distance between eachother, even the generation of collectibles is totally randomised.
